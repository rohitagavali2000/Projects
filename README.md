#Clone : Sidcup Family Golf Website

In this project, I've meticulously recreated the Sidcup Family Golf website, a versatile golf facility in Sidcup, South East London, dedicated to making golf enjoyable and accessible to all.
I used a variety of technologies to replicate the website's design and functionality, striving to maintain the original's visual appeal and interactivity.

Technologies used in this clone project:

HTML and CSS: The building blocks for the website's design and layout.
JavaScript: For creating interactive elements and animations.
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): To bring stunning animations and scroll-triggered effects to life.
Video Integration: To feature captivating video content.
Responsive Design: Ensuring seamless user experiences across diverse devices and screen sizes.
